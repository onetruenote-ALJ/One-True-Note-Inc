## Adding Minutes of Meeting:
## Date: October 22, 2023

The group came up with few use cases to design/assign to an issue:
1) Logging into the system
2) Creating a note-taking
3) Adding an event to the calendar

The group is also exploring how the app will make it more user specific. 
1) Consider an option where a user can select a role.
2) Depending on the selected role, it could give additional features to the user.

The group is exploring option if the app can be integrated to another system, for example a learning platform.
1) Need to assess this item, to avoid feature creep.
1.1) Feature creep, features added without considering whether or not these features are useful.

The group will continue working on app which has the primary feature of note taking and note organization.

The group will explore Figma to work on a prototype.
