User: college/univeristy student.

- As a college student, I want to be able to search my notes so that I can find concepts more easily when I'm studying.
- As a chemistry major, I want to be able to type chemical equations in my notes quickly so I can take more complete notes in class.
- As a computer science major, I want to include formatted code snippets in my notes so that I can make better/more interactive digital notes.
